# Hello-world
this Repo is for practicing GitHub flow
My name is Maurice. I come from a small town 
about 70 miles SE of Tucson named Sierra Vista. Im currently a Barber here 
locally in Tucson. I have been cutting hair for about 10 years. I was already in love the with the entire computer
science and engineering field, but the more I learn, the deeper the knowledge I begin to understand 
that for so long yearned to grasp hold of, fills me with hope of a future I can't even fathom any longer.
